However, the task came before many had setup git and many were confused because of this. I would also say that the task felt like being thrown in the deep end. I get that the structure of Java and OOP combined with many at Data already having programming experience but I definitely think the task expected some prior knowledge. In the end, for me atleast, it felt like an appropriate place to start and I'm now finding my stride in Java but then again, I have some programming experience and am in regular/plus.

Learning from others and actively trying to understand the concepts more deeply and also trying to understand new concepts like import and try/catch was nice. Also how I had to understand the probabilities using random variables. I think exercises can benefit from being something recognizable so we have possibility to expand and find stuff interesting instead of writing exactly to your blueprints.

I didn't find any part to be boring",10,I used up a lot of afternoons and evenings this week to really understand the code. I have a really hard time understanding so I think it was more on my side than the exercise.,5,It was relatively tiresome to understand how the attack method should be written.

Only wish I was able to dig a bit deeper into the different specific methods of ArrayLists such as removeAll() and such,2,,2,Most of it was pretty easy but some questions had some tricky parts ,Again I feel like introducing some of the methods inherent to arraylists would be nice.
